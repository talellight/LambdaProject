#LAMBDA PROJECT
Written by Talellight, Supported by CanVHave5bucks

##What is the Lambda Project?
The Lambda Project is project dedicated to science, specifically Astronomy,
For now The Lambda Project v0.1 can simulate Gravitional interactions between bodys in a 2D enviornment
Later in development we will add more fun and unique prinicples, like Collisons!


##How to use Lambda Project?
to get us started.
Mass (mass) is measured by Kilograms
The Position (pos) is measured by Meters
The Velocity (vel) is measured by Meters per Second!
Time step (dt) is measured by Seconds
Gravitational Constant (G) m³·kg⁻¹·s⁻² (6.67430e-11)

## Instructions
Enter main.py
This is our control panel that controls body.py and simulation.py
by default the sun and the earth will be in there, for example
sun = Body("Sun", 1.989e30, 0, 0) | for example: star = body("star", mass, x, y)
earth = Body("Earth", 5.972e24, 1.496e11, 0, 0, 29780) for example: planet = Body("Planet", mass, x, y, vx, vy)

## Installation process
git clone https://github.com/Talellight/LambdaProject.git
cd LambdaProject
python3 main.py (to run the code)
nano main.py (to edit your variables)

##Credits

## Notes
We will be adding some shortcuts later, aswell as ease of use, Collisions, etc!
dont divide by 0, if you do? your on your own.
